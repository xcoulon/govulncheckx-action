= govulncheck-action

A custom govulncheck action that ignores vulnerabilities listed in the `.govulncheck.yaml` file, with an expiration date to automatically stop ignoring them.
Once expired, the vulnerability will reappear in the results, prompting you to reassess it.


== `.govulncheck.yaml` file structure:

```
ignored-vulnerabilities:
    # comment vulnerability information
    - id: <vulnerability-id>
      expires: <expiration-date>
      info: <vulnerability-info-link>
```

As an example:
```
ignored-vulnerabilities:
    # Kubernetes kube-apiserver Vulnerable to Race Condition in k8s.io/kubernetes
    # More info: https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3547
    # Module: k8s.io/kubernetes
    # Fixed in: N/A
    - id: GO-2025-3547
      expires: 2020-05-10
      info: https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3547
```

== Best practices
- Before choosing to ignore a specific vulnerability, ensure that no fix or viable workaround is available.

- The expiration date for ignoring a vulnerability should be set within a one-month time frame.
